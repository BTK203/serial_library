# serial_library
Small library for easily creating or interpreting proprietary serial protocols

This was originally created for the Ohio State [Underwater Robotics Team](https://github.com/osu-uwrt) as serial processing code for the team's new fiber optic gyro, but has shown great potential as a general-purpose library. This repo serves as the grounds for the "de-ROS-ification" of the library which will make it universal.
